1) turn on verbose logging for some Avast components by running following (long) commands in Terminal app:

sudo /Applications/Avast.app/Contents/Backend/utils/com.avast.cfgctl  -c com.avast.proxy.conf -t general -v verbose -b true;sudo killall com.avast.proxy
sudo /Applications/Avast.app/Contents/Backend/utils/com.avast.cfgctl  -c com.avast.fileshield.conf -t general -v verbose -b true;sudo killall com.avast.fileshield

2) save scripts gather.sh and submit.py from this mail’s attachments to Downloads directory. 
The script gather.sh gathers specialized data about Avast processes, browsers, which process has what files opened, generates Avast support package, etc. into directory avast_gather in Documents folder.
The script submit.py may generate Avast support package if it is not done successfully by gather.sh, packs avast_gather directory and sends it to Avast’s “black hole” ftp server - the data sent there can only be retrieved by Avast employees.

3) induce the issue
4) gather data about the current state of the system by running following command in terminal:

bash ~/Downloads/gather.sh

The script will require you to input your password. The command should print some stuff to the terminal most of the time; if it does not print anything for 10+ minutes, it may be stuck (hopefully very long chance)
6) please gather full system logs while attempting to connect to a web site. In Terminal (run a new one if the gather script got stuck), run the following command to start saving system logging to file:

sudo log stream --level debug >~/Documents/avast_gather/browser_manual_connect_test.log

After that, please create a new tab in your browser and try to open some page (eg. youtube.com). When it fails, go to the Terminal app and press ctrl + c to stop the logging command

7) reboot your computer to hopefully get Mac to working state and turn off verbose logging again via:
sudo /Applications/Avast.app/Contents/Backend/utils/com.avast.cfgctl  -c com.avast.proxy.conf -t general -v verbose -b false; sudo killall com.avast.proxy
sudo /Applications/Avast.app/Contents/Backend/utils/com.avast.cfgctl  -c com.avast.fileshield.conf -t general -v verbose -b false; sudo killall com.avast.fileshield
8) Send the gathered data to Avast. You can check the avast_gather directory in Documents first to verify the data that is being sent. Send it by starting Terminal app and in it run the following command:
python2 submit.py
